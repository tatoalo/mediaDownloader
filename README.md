</div>

mediaDownloader can be used to download and deliver media from a selection of sources.

Sometimes on TikTok (I know üò´) there's some proper quality content that I need to immediately deliver to somebody, this takes care of this in a pretty straightforward way.

There are 3 main binaries:

- `media_downloader`, responsible for downloading the media from the source
- `bot`, responsible for receiving the request and delivering the media to the user
- `cleaner`, responsible for cleaning up the downloaded media after a certain amount of time (externally managed)

### Docker

The container expects to load the [configuration file](#configuration) from `/mediaDownloader/config.toml` so mount a volume accordingly.

```
$ docker run -itd \
             --rm \
             -v /path/to/my/configuration/file:/config/file \
             tatoalo/media-downloader
```

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mediadownloader:
    image: tatoalo/media-downloader:development
    container_name: mediadownloader
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /path/to/my/configuration/file:/config/file
```

### Configuration

The configuration file allows to have control over multiple aspects of the downloader.

```toml
[telegram]
token = "token"

[redis]
username = "username"
password = "password"
host = "host"
port = 6942
channel = "channel"

[supported_sites]
sites = [
    "site1.com",
    "site2.com",
]

[telemetry]
endpoint = "endpoint"
api_key = "api_key"

[aweme_api]
[...]
```

#### Telegram ü§ñ

The only parameter required is the `token` of the bot you want to use, for more information refer to the [official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather).

#### Redis

The downloader uses `redis` as a message broker and to store the `video ID` in order to save processing/delivery times and bandwidth.
The required parameters are:

- `username`
- `password`
- `host`
- `port`
- `channel`

#### Supported Sites

The downloader uses a `supported_sites` whitelist to determine admissable sources.

#### Aweme_API

TikTok support üòâ

#### Telemetry (Optional)

The downloader can be instrumented to send traces via [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to a remote endpoint.

#### Custom Scheduling (Cleaner)

The default scheduling mechanism is stored in `media-downloader-cron`, although a custom schedule can be introduced in one of two ways:

- Edit `media-downloader-cron` accordingly and rebuild the image
- Edit the environment variables directly in the `docker run` command or `docker compose` file, namely.
  It is possible to customize the behaviour via the following env variable:
  - `CLEANER_CRON` for when the cleaning mechanism is executed

#### Monitoring

An additional environment variable can be set in order to monitor the health of the `cleaner` cron job:

- `HC_UUID_CLEANER`

Its value must be an `healthchecks`-compatible `uuid` (or `slug`).
I've been a fan of [cronitor](https://cronitor.io/) but [healtchecks](https://healthchecks.io/)'s free offering is more convenient in my opinion.
